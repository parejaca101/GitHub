      <h2>Concert #1: Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> May 13, 2023</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Philadelphia, PA</p>
      <p>From the moment Taylor Swift stepped onto the Lincoln Financial Field stage, Philly Night 2 was pure magic. The crowd—70,000 strong—erupted as she opened with “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,” setting the tone for a night that would span 17 years of music, memories, and meticulous storytelling.
      <p>Taylor didn’t just perform—she put on a SHOW. Each era was a cinematic experience, complete with dazzling costume changes, immersive visuals, and choreography that had the entire stadium on its feet. The “Reputation” set felt like a thunderstorm of power and precision, while the “Folklore” cabin moment offered a breath of intimacy that hushed the crowd in awe.
      <p>Highlights? The surprise song mashup of “Gold Rush” and “Come Back...Be Here” had fans sobbing and screaming in equal measure. And when she closed with “Karma,” fireworks lit up the Philly sky like a final exclamation point on a night that felt like a dream.
      <p>It wasn’t just a concert—it was a masterclass in performance, emotion, and connection. Taylor Swift reminded everyone why she’s the defining artist of a generation.</p>

      <h2>Concert #2: Wallows | UPB Concert</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> October 3, 2025S</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> The Atlantic Union Bank Center, Harrisonburg, VA</p>
      <p>Wallows lit up Harrisonburg with a set that was nothing short of ELECTRIC. From the first chord to the final encore, the energy was off the charts—and I had the best seat in the house: barricade in the GA pit, close enough to feel every beat and catch every grin from the band.
      <p>The opener? Absolutely nailed it. Their dreamy, indie-pop vibe warmed up the crowd perfectly, setting the stage for Wallows to take over with their signature blend of nostalgia, grit, and pure serotonin. The lighting design pulsed with every drop, and the crowd was locked in from the jump.
      <p>But the moment that sent the arena into full-blown chaos? During “Are You Bored Yet,” Duke Dog—yes, the JMU mascot—bounded onto the stage in full costume, dancing alongside Dylan, Braeden, and Cole like he’d been part of the band all along. The crowd lost it. Phones were up, voices were loud, and the band leaned into the madness with huge smiles and an impromptu jam session.
      <p>It was one of those nights that felt like a fever dream in the best way. Wallows didn’t just play a show—they created a memory that Harrisonburg won’t forget anytime soon.</p>

      <h2>Concert #3: Harry Styles | Love On Tour</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 3, 2022</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Madison Square Garden, New York City</p>
      <p>There are concerts—and then there are Harry Styles concerts. Night 12 of his MSG residency was a euphoric, emotional rollercoaster that left me absolutely breathless. From the moment the lights dimmed and the first notes of “Music for a Sushi Restaurant” hit, I was all in—singing my heart out to every single song.
      <p>Harry didn’t just perform—he connected. I laughed, cried, screamed, and danced like nobody was watching. The crowd was electric, and Harry fed off that energy with every wink, twirl, and high note. “Matilda” had me in tears, “Watermelon Sugar” turned the arena into a disco, and “As It Was” felt like a collective release of joy and nostalgia.
      <p>The staging was intimate yet grand, with Harry strutting down the catwalk like it was his personal runway. Confetti rained down during “Sign of the Times,” and the entire arena felt like one big, glittering hug.
      <p>I would absolutely see him again in a heartbeat. That night at MSG wasn’t just a concert—it was a celebration of love, freedom, and pure pop magic.</p>

      <h2>Concert #4: Phoebe Bridgers | Reunion Tour</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> June 11, 2022</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> The Anthem, Washington, DC</p>
      <p>Phoebe Bridgers turned The Anthem into a dreamscape on June 11th, and I was lucky enough to be right at the barricade in the GA pit—front row for a night that felt like stepping into her world. The set was gorgeous, with ethereal backgrounds that shifted from soft twilight hues to haunting moonlit scenes, perfectly echoing the emotional arc of her music.
      <p>From the first strum of “Motion Sickness” to the final notes of “I Know the End,” the vibes were immaculate. Phoebe’s voice was raw and tender, her presence magnetic, and every lyric hit like a secret shared between friends. Sharing the experience with my best friend made it even more unforgettable—we laughed, swayed, and soaked in every moment together.
      <p>It wasn’t just a concert. It was a quiet kind of catharsis, wrapped in glittering visuals and poetic melancholy. Phoebe Bridgers made DC feel like the center of the universe that night.</p>

      <h2>Concert #5: Clairo | All Things Go Festival</h2>
      <p><strong>Date:</strong> September 27, 2025</p>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Merriweather Post Pavilion, Columbia, MD</p>
      <p>Clairo’s set at All Things Go was a masterclass in understated elegance. From the moment she stepped on stage, everything felt effortlessly refined—her vocals were soft and stunning, the band was tight and polished, and the entire aesthetic was classy without being overdone. The lighting, visuals, and transitions were seamless, creating a dreamy atmosphere that wrapped the crowd in warmth.
      <p>She did mistakenly call us the wrong city a few times (sorry, Columbia!), which was unfortunate but honestly kind of hilarious. The crowd took it in stride, laughing along with her, and Clairo handled it with charm and humility. It was one of those moments that made the show feel even more personal and real.
      <p>Among all the incredible artists I saw that day, Clairo’s performance stood out as my absolute favorite. There was something magnetic about her presence—intimate, graceful, and quietly powerful. I left the festival feeling completely fulfilled, already counting down the days until I get to see her again. That set was everything: gorgeous, grounded, and unforgettable.</p>
